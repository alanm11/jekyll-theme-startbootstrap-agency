There are plenty of places to stay on the Costa del Sol as it is known as a sunshine destination.

The recommended areas we suggest you stay are La Cala de Mijas and Fuengirola. They are located inbetween the wedding ceremony and the reception which will be ideal for any travel you will need to take.

There will be Hotels, Apartments and Villas abound in the area. Also AirBnb options if you prefer.

We are planning to have bus transport organised for guests from a set location in La Cala de Mijas and Fuengirola to the Wedding Ceremony and onwards to the reception. A taxi back to your residence will be the only thing to consider, which we will be able to organise for you on the night, whenever your night is done.

Some recommended hotels:

[Tamisa Hotel](https://www.hoteltamisagolf.com){:target="_blank"} located near some Golf courses.

[IPV Palace](https://www.hotelipvpalace.com/en/){:target="_blank"} in Fuengirola

[Fuengirola Beach Hotel](https://www.fuengirolabeach.com/en/){:target="_blank"} in the center of Fuengirola

[El Oceano Hotel](https://www.oceanohotel.com/){:target="_blank"} for those with a little bit of a larger budget to spend.

For Villa and Apartment options we were recommended [Greenside Properties](https://greenside-properties.com/properties/){:target="_blank"} who should be able to help. There should be plenty of options for those willing to dig a bit further beyond Greenside Properties.
