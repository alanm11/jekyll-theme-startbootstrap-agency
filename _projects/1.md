There are many ways to reach Malaga. 

Flying would be the best way, but feel free to take a road trip if you're on for an adventure! 

Flying directly into Malaga would be the easiest option.

All major airlines from Ireland fly to Malaga from all of the major airports. We would recommend using Aer Lingus but Ryanair and others all operate to Malaga.

Nearby Airports in Granada and Seville are also options instead of Malaga. Granada is 1 hour 40 minutes drive from Fuengirola. Seville is 2 hours 20 mins drive as an example.

The cheapest option will be using Ryanair and, for the best flight options across the week, your best bet will be Dublin Airport.

Shannon Airport have flight options on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

Knock Airport fly to Malaga on Saturdays in May if you are looking to make a holiday out of the week before for example.

Cork is also an option but for a bit more of a premium.

Dublin Airport will be the best option. There are flight options everyday of the week.
