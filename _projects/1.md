There are many ways to reach Malaga. 

Flying would be the primary way but feel free to take a road trip if you please. 

All major airlines from Ireland fly to Malaga from all of the major airports. We would recommend using Aer Lingus but Ryanair and others all operate to Malaga.

On top of flying directly into Malaga, Sevilla is another nearby destination if you would like to spend some time sightseeing before the wedding.
